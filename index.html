        <li><strong>7 BA</strong> - Neo the pug was born in the peaceful village of Carlington, in North Dekota. <br>At the moment of his birth, the owner noticed this pug was different, since instead of crawling up to his mother to get the milk, he first stared for hours into the distant sky with things on its young mind even philosophers could not understand.</li>
        
        <li><strong>6 BA</strong> - Neo wandered at one year old into a dark looking alley not noticing he was being surrounded by a pack of angry baby kittens out for K-9 blood. Normal instincts would tell to make a run for it. However Neo just stood still as if frozen in time. The kittens retreated when a strange wave of new insights hit them, for they suddenly understood the nature of their own anger and realised they no longer needed to suffer from their own tormented feelings.</li>
        
        <li><strong>4 BA</strong> - In Neos fourth year on earth, he encountered a dying pug brother from another mother. 
  He stood by while he saw the life leaving him. As this happened Neo could feel tears welling
  up behind his eyes. But Neo sensed he needed not be sad, we he saw the soul of his brother ascending 
  to a higher realm of calm and peace. So he realised at that day the cycle of birth and dead.</li>
        
        <li><strong>2 BA</strong> - On Neo's fifth birthday party where there was lots of cake prepared by his owners.
  Neo could not eat anything from it. He looked at all the delicious treats but sensed all the 
  starving and hungry beings incarnated on this earth. So out of symphaty for these souls, 
  he refused to eat that day. </li>
        
        <li><strong>108 days BA</strong> - Neo wandered around the garden. Thinking how to spend his time. He was his toys, 
His friends behind the fence. He also say a tree in the middle of the garden. 
When looking at the tree he felt a strange sense of longing of purpose. 
So on this day he took his seat and closed his eyes. He started to contemplate every tiny aspect 
of our reality. As if unwinding the creation itself in his ever expanding consciousness.</li>
        
        <li><strong>1 day BA</strong> - After 107 days of deep meditation under the garden tree, he was cold and his body fragil. 
His retarded owners finally found him and brought him inside.
He opened his eyes and felt a sudden surge of sadness that he was denied to reach the ultimate state 
under that tree. He felt as if the world of illusions and the ignorance of his owners was holding him back. 
So his owners put a warm wollen blanket over him hoping he would be ok.</li>
        
        <li><strong>10 mins BA</strong> - Neo still struck with sadness started to gase between the space between his eyes. 
Was it emptyness? he asked himself. What is this space between objects. 
He started penetrating with his focus the subtle fabric of space-time. He could see stars unfolding 
from tiny infinites. Atoms enlarging to galaxies. He started feeling the atoms of his body vibrating in tune 
with a eternal frequency.</li>
        
        <li><strong>MOMENT OF ASCENSION</strong> - Neo started to lose the concept of himself, his life, his body was just a temporal role
he played in a finite manifested dance under the gaze of his eternal omnipresent self. 
Suddenly he was lost, but found himself everywhere, in every corner of the universe. 
There was no atom in the universe that did not reverberated the same as himself. 
He had become the universe.  </li>
